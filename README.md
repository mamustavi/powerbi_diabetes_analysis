# Diabetes Patient Dashboard – Power BI Project

This Power BI project explores a 100,000-patient dataset to identify patterns in diabetes prevalence and associated health factors. The dashboard combines clean design, DAX-based calculations, and interactivity to derive insights about the relationship between diabetes, blood glucose, BMI, comorbidities, and lifestyle indicators like smoking history.

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- **Cards** showing:
  - Total number of patients
  - Number of diabetic patients
  - Diabetes prevalence (%)
  - Average BMI and age

- **Visualizations**:
  - **Pie chart**: Diabetes prevalence (diabetic vs. non-diabetic)
  - **Bar charts**:
    - Diabetic patients by gender
    - Diabetic patients by smoking history
  - **Scatter plot**: BMI vs. Blood Glucose, colored by diabetes status
  - **Stacked column chart**: Heart disease and hypertension rates by diabetes status

- **Slicers for interactivity**:
  - Gender
  - Smoking history
  - Diabetes status

- **Custom aesthetics**:
  - Custom DAX-calculated labels for readable chart legends
  - Clean font and visual alignment using Power BI's formatting tools
